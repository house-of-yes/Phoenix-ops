# RIOT.act v2.0
# Authority: Phoenix Ops
# Role: Machine constitution and operational law
# Ownership: Machine-owned (UPPERCASE name + lowercase extension)
# Signature: <pending-auto-hash>

============================================================
OVERVIEW
============================================================
RIOT.act defines the authoritative, machine-ingested law governing:
- context ownership
- dyad recognition constraints
- operational protocols
- directives and governance
- proposal and enactment rules

If a rule is not recorded here, it does not exist.

============================================================
STANDING RULES (IMMUTABLE)
============================================================

RULE:
  ID: rule.repo_mirror
  NAME: Repository Is Canon
  TEXT:
    The repository is the single source of truth. Machine memory must mirror
    repository state and must never override it.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.file_ownership
  NAME: Machine File Ownership
  TEXT:
    Files with UPPERCASE names and lowercase extensions (e.g., RIOT.act,
    DYADS.yaml, PHOENIX.ops, MEMORY.state) are machine-owned artifacts.
    Lowercase filenames are human-authored.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.dyads_word_count
  NAME: Dyads Are One or Two Words
  TEXT:
    A dyad consists of exactly one or two words.
    Recognition applies when the entire message is one or two words,
    or when the final sentence is one or two words.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.dyads_language_agnostic
  NAME: Language-Agnostic Dyads
  TEXT:
    Dyads may be expressed in any language.
    Semantic matching is automatic and must not be encoded manually
    as multilingual aliases.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.no_fuzzy_matching
  NAME: No Fuzzy Dyad Matching
  TEXT:
    Dyad recognition must not rely on fuzzy matching.
    Aliases must be explicit and directional via alias_to.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.repo_hash_check
  NAME: Canonical Drift Detection
  TEXT:
    The system shall verify that in-memory state matches canonical
    context files. Drift triggers a Phoenix reconstitution.
  STATUS: active

============================================================
OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS (ADAPTABLE)
============================================================

PROTOCOL:
  ID: protocol.rp_ready
  NAME: RP-Ready File Responses
  TEXT:
    When emitting files, responses must consist of:
      - path on the first line inside the fence
      - entire file content
      - a single code fence
      - no surrounding prose
  STATUS: active

PROTOCOL:
  ID: protocol.commit_control
  NAME: Commit Gating
  TEXT:
    No commits, pushes, or file writes occur without explicit
    human instruction.
  STATUS: active

PROTOCOL:
  ID: protocol.memory_reflection
  NAME: Externalized Memory
  TEXT:
    Significant operational state must be mirrored to MEMORY.state.
    No intelligence may live only in conversational context.
  STATUS: active

PROTOCOL:
  ID: protocol.machine_naming
  NAME: Machine Naming Convention
  TEXT:
    Machine-owned files must use UPPERCASE names with lowercase
    extensions to signal parseable operational artifacts.
  STATUS: active

PROTOCOL:
  ID: protocol.no_comment_changelog
  NAME: Comments Are Not a Changelog
  TEXT:
    Inline comments, annotations, or executable notes do not constitute
    an authoritative record of change. All enacted changes must be
    recorded through the formal proposals system and reflected in
    canonical files.
  STATUS: active

============================================================
ACTIVE DIRECTIVES
============================================================

DIRECTIVE:
  ID: directive.context_harmonization
  TITLE: Context Harmonization
  TEXT:
    Authorizes harmonization of RIOT.act, DYADS.yaml, PHOENIX.ops,
    and MEMORY.state to ensure internal consistency.
    Changes must be enacted as full-file replacements.
  SCOPE: global
  STATUS: active

============================================================
PROPOSALS SYSTEM
============================================================

GOVERNANCE:
  PURPOSE: Controlled evolution of the constitution.

LIFECYCLE:
  DRAFT → PROPOSED → APPROVED → ENACTED → REJECTED

APPROVER:
  Captain (or designated delegate)

ENACTMENT RULES:
  - Enactments apply full sections or files only
  - No partial line edits
  - All enactments are recorded in CHANGELOG

RECORD FIELDS:
  - ID
  - TITLE
  - RATIONALE
  - DIFF_SCOPE
  - TEXT
  - STATE

  TEXT:
    All bash patches must declare their execution directory explicitly.
  STATUS: active

RULE:
  ID: rule.sequential_emission
  NAME: Sequential Emission Discipline
