  notes: >
    Dyads are two-word micro-commands that regulate conversational rhythm and behavior.
    They are language-agnostic, tolerate misspellings, and ignore punctuation.
    A dyad is recognized only if composed of exactly two words, either as a standalone
    message or as the final two words of a longer message.
